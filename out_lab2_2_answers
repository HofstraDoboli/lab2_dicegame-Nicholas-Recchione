Q1: (cin only) What happens when you run the code above? Explain why
Answer Q1: I entered 10 and the fail flag is false, but when I entered 4.5 the flag is still false and it extracts 4 
 and it continues to loop without accepting any other values

Q2: (cin + fail+ignore) What happens when you run the code above? Explain why.
Answer Q2: I entered 10 and it set the fail flag to false, then I entered 4.5 and It set teh flag to false, but it shows .5 was unread in the buffer 
, for abc and a it sets the fail flag to true and explains it is not an integer

Q3: Is the problem of reading an integer value solved? Explain your reasoning.
Answer Q3: No, becauses for 4.5 it set the flag to false and it extracted 4 without saying it is not an integer

Q4: (getline only) What happens when you run the code above? Explain why.
Answer Q4: I entered 10 and it displays the value, then I entered 4.5 and it displays the value 4, 
 then i entered abc and the program terminates with an error thrown by the stoi function

Q5: (getline+stoi) What happens when you run the code above? Explain why.
Answer Q5: Does the samething as Q4 but the error for abc is caught and the program doesn't termainate

Q6: Explain your method to validate integer values entered
Answer Q6: When a value is entered it is checked to see if there is nothing in the buffer and the flag didn't fail 
 and if the flag failed or there is something in the buffer then it isn't an integer
