Welcome to my dice game!

The game of craps is perhaps the most famous of all dice games. 
The player begin by throwing two standard dice. If the sum of 
these dice is 7 or 11, the player wins. If the sum is 2,3 or 12, 
the player loses. Otherwise, the sum becomes the playerâ€™s point. 
The player continues to roll until either the point comes up again, in which 
case the player wins, or the player throws 7, in which case they lose.
